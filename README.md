# Recommender_System
A movie recommendation system using collaborative, content-based, and hybrid filtering on the MovieLens dataset. It provides personalized suggestions, handles new users with cold-start recommendations, and simulates real-time updates based on incoming user ratings


# Features
Collaborative Filtering: Recommends movies based on similar usersâ€™ ratings.

Content-Based Filtering: Recommends movies similar to those a user has liked, based on genres.

Hybrid Recommender: Combines collaborative and content-based scores for improved recommendations.

Cold-Start Handling: Suggests top-rated movies for new users with no rating history.

Real-Time Simulation: Demonstrates dynamic updating of recommendations as new user ratings arrive.

# Dataset; Uses the MovieLens dataset (ratings.csv and movies.csv).

# Usage
Load the ratings and movies datasets.

Run the script.

Enter a user ID when prompted to get personalized recommendations via collaborative, content-based, and hybrid methods.

View cold-start recommendations for new users.

Observe real-time simulation of incoming ratings updating recommendations dynamically.

# to be noted that SVD simulations were not ran even due to package constraints( using svd can help improve the recommendations ). 


# RESULT 
the main code will help generate the collabrative recommendations along with the hybrid and content based recommendations for user 1 as an example, where after it allows the user to enter a userID for which the model generates recommendations. the Real time simulations intake the new rating a said user and update their movie recommendations for it.
